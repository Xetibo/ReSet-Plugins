# ReSet-Keyboard
This plugin features the configuration of keyboard layouts. It offers both a DBus interface and a graphical user interface in order to cover a wide range of users.
Note: This plugin uses the XDG standard for handling keyboard layouts, hence only 4 active keyboard layouts are currently allowed. Should a new standard be implemented, this plugin can be adapted for the new standard.

## Environment Support
## Installation
Simply compile the plugin and move it to the ReSet plugins folder in your .config directory.
